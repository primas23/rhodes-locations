# Rhodos Locations

## The Medieval City of Rhodes

This UNESCO World Heritage site is the largest and best preserved fortified city in Europe!

When the knights of Saint-John arrived on the island in 1309, they decided to build this impressive citadel. The 4-km long fortified walls, with many strongholds and towers, are extremely well-preserved.

There are only pedestrian streets inside the walls. You will be able to take a nice stroll and enjoy its charming paved alleys and historical monuments. Nowadays, the medieval city of Rhodes is entirely dedicated to tourism: you will find there many taverns, restaurants and shops. The place is also very busy (even if I visited Rhodes at the end of September!).

The best places to see in Rhodes are:

## Rhodes’ castles

When visiting Rhodes, you should also discover the island’s many castles.

Most of these castles were built in the 15th century by the Knights of Saint John and were used as observation posts:

* [Kritinia Castle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kritinia+Castle/@36.2629802,27.8019762,15.39z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x149598bff39b9851:0x30559ad0b643a5d!8m2!3d36.2641244!4d27.8089339) is located close to the village of the same name. Climb a few steps to access the entrance and go inside the fortified walls. From there, you will enjoy a great view over the sea.
* [Monolithos Castle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Castle+of+Monolithos/@36.1245168,27.7239694,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x1495bac801d8c54f:0x12336c741e65e12a!8m2!3d36.1245168!4d27.7261581) is located 5 kilometers after the village of Siana. It was erected at the top of a 236-meter high hill by the Grand Masters in 1476. It’s a great viewpoint, with a panorama of the bay, Chalki island and the mountains.

* [Feraklos Castle](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Feraklos+Castle/@36.0242066,27.7252713,8.93z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14950d4d3a35da21:0xcd55d4daaa4e9d6f!8m2!3d36.1702501!4d28.098651), a medieval castle located close to the Charaki village and right next to Agathi beach. This huge fortress was erected on top of a hill, overlooking the bays of Agathi and Malonas. You might have the chance to be alone during your visit, as the place isn’t mentioned in any tourist guide. Don’t forget your hiking shoes, as the short trail is steep and rocky.
* [The Castle of Archangelos](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Archangelos+Fort+Castle/@36.211713,28.1188455,17z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sCastle+of+Archangelos!3m4!1s0x0:0x264b71d9e199b3cd!8m2!3d36.211713!4d28.1188455), built by the Knights on the ruins of a former Byzantine Castle.

## Ancient site of [Kamiros](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kameiros+851+06,+Greece/@36.3358322,27.9126342,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14959d81c5218201:0x7350af8c61256c0a!8m2!3d36.335833!4d27.921389)

![](https://www.rhodesguide.com/media_www/images/344916741/201807/RhodesGuide_f831e_city-of-kamiros.jpg)

This archaeological site is located around 35 km Southwest of Rhodes City.

With Lindos and Ialyssos, Kamiros is one of the 3 ancient cities founded by the Dorians. It was built on 3 levels following the Hippodamian grid system (urban planning):

* At the top of the Hill, you will find the Temple of Athena and the Acropolis
* The middle level was the main part of the city, with the inhabitants’ houses
* On the lowest level, you can discover another Temple and the Doric fountain.

You can visit Kamiros for 6€. From the top of the hill, you will enjoy a breathtaking view and discover how huge this city was. All the explanations signs on the site are in Greek and in English, which is quite unusual in Greece!

## [The Valley of the Butterflies](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Valley+of+the+Butterflies/@36.3400187,28.0576926,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14957081f6bf6bc1:0xece283cdb05d1514!8m2!3d36.3400187!4d28.0598813)
![](https://rhodos.gr/wp-content/uploads/butterfly-valley-1857235352_a91b9fca68_b2.jpg)

The Valley of the Butterflies is among the best things to do in Rhodes.

It’s located in the North of the island, 26 km from Rhodes city, between the villages of Paradisi and Theologos.

Between June and September, you can observe hundreds of butterflies literally covering all the trees, as the valley’s climate and environment is perfect for their reproduction. The valley is one of Europe’s best sanctuaries for the Callimorpha Quadripunctaria butterflies.

The valley hosts a rare specie of plane tree, and the butterflies are really fond of its sap! That’s why you will find so many of them there.

This natural site is quite large: you can walk along the marked trails in the woods and near the river to observe the butterflies.

And if you want to learn more about Rhodes’ wildlife, you can visit the Natural History Museum located in the valley.

You can park your car, get information and buy your tickets at one of the 3 entrances to the Valley. As the site is quite steep, you can also ride the “Butterfly Train” to get to the top and walk a bit less.

The entrance ticket costs 5€ between June and September and 2€ the rest of the year, when there are no butterflies. It’s still a great place to take a stroll and enjoy a beautiful natural environment.

## [Tsambika Monastery](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Monastery+Tsambika/@36.2353636,28.1232982,13.61z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14956dc3aee1371b:0xe1ad397824b34857!8m2!3d36.2358783!4d28.1495567)

![](https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-09-at-4.54.53-pm.png)

Tsambika Monastery is another place you should visit in Rhodes.

The Monastery is, in fact, a really small Byzantine church built on top of the mountain. You have to climb more than 300 steps to get there! Hopefully, The place is mostly shady and there are many benches to rest. Just take your time and it won’t be difficult.

Once you’re up there, you’ll be rewarded by a magnificent view of Tsambika Beach and most of Rhodes. It’s clearly worth the (small) effort!

The church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. As an anecdote, you should know that women who cannot get pregnant were climbing up here on their bare feet to pray the Virgin Mary. If they got pregnant, they had to call their babies Tsambikos for a boy, and Tsampikas for a girl.

## [Seven Springs / Epta Piges](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seven+Springs/@36.2537394,28.1118562,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x14956e0243efb7eb:0x676c7cd9042012cc!8m2!3d36.2537394!4d28.1140449)

![](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/13/59/b3/aa/epta-piges.jpg)

It’s time to continue this Rhodes tourist guide with a really great place if you want to relax by the water: the Seven Springs.

The Seven Springs (or Epta Piges in Greek) are located 4 km from the village of Kolymbia, not far from Tsambika Monastery.

There, 7 springs are gushing from the mountain in the same place to create a river. On the site, you will find a marked trail as well as a restaurant by the water. The place is very frequented by locals, and people are coming here to enjoy the beautiful natural environment and taste Greek specialities. There is also a playground for children.

Epta Piges’ most famous attraction is its tunnel. The river goes underground for a moment, to come out on the other side of the hill. You can follow the watercourse and walk in a very narrow and dark underground tunnel.

You will walk for around 180m underground to reach a small lake. Don’t do it if you’re claustrophobic or afraid of the dark, as you can’t turn back once you’re inside. It feels a bit like being in a zombie movie!

If you don’t want to go underground, you can reach the other side of the tunnel using the short trail through the forest.
