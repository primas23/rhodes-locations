# Rhodos Locations

## The Medieval City of Rhodes

This UNESCO World Heritage site is the largest and best preserved fortified city in Europe!

When the knights of Saint-John arrived on the island in 1309, they decided to build this impressive citadel. The 4-km long fortified walls, with many strongholds and towers, are extremely well-preserved.

There are only pedestrian streets inside the walls. You will be able to take a nice stroll and enjoy its charming paved alleys and historical monuments. Nowadays, the medieval city of Rhodes is entirely dedicated to tourism: you will find there many taverns, restaurants and shops. The place is also very busy (even if I visited Rhodes at the end of September!).
